Public Transportation and Covid-19 (Brief)

Multilayer networks can be used to model many complex systems. Principally, when two or more complex systems interact and when these systems have different origins and dynamics because some systems could change the behaviors in a significant way, both agents into the system and the whole system. In other words, the coupling of networks can lead to system-wide behavior which differs from the behavior of each network \cite {10.1093/comnet/cnu016, Buldyrev2010, PhysRevE.89.042811, PhysRevE.90.062816, PhysRevE.89.062814}.
Public transport as a complex system could have a multimodal structure depending on the city and could couple of different transportation networks from the quality, quantity, geography, and population. However, some analysis uses the single structure of transportation with good results for particular transport systems \cite{PhysRevE.80.021136, LIANG20122135, DERRIBLE20103678, PhysRevE.72.046127, Xingetal} to list a few, but did not work when you need to identify the whole transport system, especially, space and temporal structures, as well as the connection with other city networks.
In the last decade, some works have provided multilayer network approaches for public transport networks \cite {PhysRevLett.109.128703, Gallotti2014, Gallotti2015, ASGARI201669, Aleta2017, doi:10.1098/rsos.160156, Baggag2018}. In this case, we tried to integrate the multimodal public transport structure with the COVID-19 cases to identify the correlation and the dynamics of COVID-19, as well as the influence of public transport to propagate the virus in some US cities.
